# Greetings! 

I am Alex Kostylev, and this repository showcases examples of my coding projects and skills.

I have extensive experience of using Python for data analytics, including data generation and manipulation with Pandas, analysis and visualisation.

Throughout my PhD, I have applied both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, including the use of large language models (LLMs). Some examples of this work are included here.

I have also used Python for web scraping using Selenium and working with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) API.

Finally, I am taking part in Kaggle competitions and plan to uppload more codes into this depository.
